The elephants are fed milk at 9 am and 1 pm and given a  bath from 10 am to 12 pm. The remaining hours consist of   watching the elephants interact with each other in their  respective closed boundaries.</p>

        <p class="class-desctiption">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The city  of Kandy earned the title World Heritage Site because of   the presence of a sacred tooth relic temple, Temple of the  Tooth. As the name suggests, the temple houses Lord  Buddha’s tooth which had been transferred all the way from   Kalinga to Kandy. It is now stationed at this temple which  holds 3 pujas a day to honor and venerate Lord Buddha.   However, nobody for the past so many years has actually   seen the relic. This is exactly what draws so many people   to this temple every year. The endless wondering that is  followed by a person’s visit to the temple is not only   thought-provoking but also leads them to so many  conclusions. It is a mystery whether the temple really has   the tooth or was it lost in the midst of the temple’s   colorful history. This is something you will have to  decide after taking a tour of the Temple of the Tooth, for   yourself.</p>

        <p class="class-desctiption">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Knuckles  Mountain range is an unusual terrestrial landform located  in Matale and Kandy, in Central Province, Sri Lanka. The   range is a World Heritage Conservation Area and is  relatively untouched. The range features 34 peaks, ranging   between 900 metres to 2000 metres. Five of these mountain   peaks make the formation of a clenched fist. <br>

          &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The name was given by the British,   and the locals call this range 'Dumbara Kanduvetiya',   which means mist-laden mountains. The knuckles Mountain   Range is called so because of its uncanny resemblance to  the fingers of a clenched fist. <br>

          &ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The range, with its grasslands,  rugged peaks, meandering roads and cascading streams and   waterfalls are a vibrant biodiversity zone. Despite   being only 0.03% of the country's area, this zone   consists of 34% of Sri Lanka's endemic vegetation.
