            <h3>Promoting Sri Lanka and its many diverse facets to the World</h3>
            <img src="https://srilanka.travel/image/data/news2021/23-12-2021/cover_img.jpg" alt="image">
            <p>The contemporary traveler has a limitless choice of destinations and experiences all competing for their time and money.  The ability to communicate a destination’s many aspects is vital when appealing to an international audience. Unfortunately, this is something that had not happened in the past. In fact, the great tragedy is that Sri Lanka has so much more to offer than just about any other location in the region. Yet no one knows anything much about the island, save for its beaches, which have been the sole focus of all previous marketing efforts. <br> In a bid to rectify this glaring oversight, Sri Lanka Tourism has undertaken an extensive integrated communication campaign, which showcases the island’s many diverse facets to the world. These international marketing efforts include advertising, international public relations, trade shows, special events, online marketing, and sponsorship activity. There are also ongoing efforts, in key source markets, to create awareness and demand for the Sri Lanka brand. The broader integrated campaign aims to capture the hearts, minds, and imagination of the target audience. An ambitious project by any standard, one which had never been attempted before. Since the campaign's inception, however, extraordinary things have happened, and the world has started to notice. This, in turn, has enabled Sri Lanka to achieve top-of-mind awareness among its target audience. While also impressing international media giants, industry experts, and celebrity influencers. The initial campaign by Sri Lanka Tourism has resulted in millions of dollars’ worth of free coverage that has taken the island and its offering to a whole new audience. <br> <b> “The pandemic has been a crisis of unexpected proportions and a disaster for tourism globally. Fortunately, we have been proactive and utilized the downtime to regroup and redirect our efforts, to ensure a faster road to recovery for the entire sector.” Remarked Ms. Kimarli Fernando, Chairperson, Sri Lanka Tourism. She went on to add, “Having an island brimming with exotic treasures would not count for much, if we did not show the world just how magnificent and diverse Sri Lanka really is. Of course, we have always been world-famous for our beaches. However, our latest campaign goes beyond the known and showcases a side of Sri Lanka the world has never seen before.”</b> <br> The government's quick response to the pandemic, including policy and infrastructural changes has enabled the island to stay ahead of the curb. This also helped raise the islands standing in the eyes of the world. During the course of 2021, these measures enabled Sri Lanka’s borders to remain open for a select group of travelers, who had been vaccinated and complied with all health and safety requirements. In fact, the Sri Lanka Tourism’s Visiting Blogger Program (VBP) and Visiting Journalist Program (VJP) have been even greater successes than originally imagined. Several recent campaigns included some of the world's biggest youtube travel sensations and e-influencers. With specialized content created in Sri Lanka reaching over 2.8 million views and 937,000 views on youtube alone. These efforts have helped portray the island as one of the safest destinations for post-Covid travel. While taking viewers through the island’s impressively diverse landscape and earning the title ‘’Unforgettable Holiday Maker’. <br> Those responsible for the island’s recent rise to fame could hardly have hoped for better response, given the world sat up and took notice. Some of the most recent efforts included extensive coverage of the island by 23 mainstream International media publications, Travel Writers, and International Travel Influencers. This is estimated to have generated a combined reach, via social media and other online platforms, of over 72 million viewers and advocates. In just the last three months over 500 individual social media posts and online news articles have spotlighted the island. The world’s biggest media outlets have also taken notice and this year alone several leading media platforms have advocated for the island and the many wonders it has to offer. This includes illustrious media outlets such as The Guardian-UK, BBC. Travel, Travel + Leisure India, National Geographic Traveler India, Vogue Ukraine, Aeroflot Inflight Magazine Russia, Buro247 Ukraine, Harper Bazar, Onmanorama- India, USA Today, and many more. This widespread publicity across the globe has brought visitors to the island even with global travel restrictions, providing much-needed respite for a sector that has been amongst the worst affected by recent events. Thus far, there have been 22,771 visitors in October and 44,294 arrivals in November. These numbers are immensely hopeful and show early signs of recovery and optimism. What the data by itself does not reveal is a sharp increase in high-value tourists, who place an emphasis on novel experiences and have excellent long-haul potential. In fact, one of the primary aspects of the ongoing strategic communication and marketing campaign is tailoring a message that would appeal to this very lucrative segment. <br> These efforts also dovetail into government policy initiatives that desire to bring about a more sustainable, inclusive, and progressive tourism industry. One which moves away from generic mass-market tourism to something altogether more authentic, unique, and memorable. <br> <b>Contact:</b> <br>Public Relations Division<br>Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau <br>80, Galle Road, Colombo 03. </p>

            <h3>Press Release: Santani becomes the first Sri Lankan hotel to be selected as “worlds best” – hailed as Best Wellness Retreat in the World by Travel+Leisure India</h3>
            <img src="https://srilanka.travel/image/data/news2021/21-12-2021/EFV-20211024-%20Sri%20Lanka%20Road%20Trip-%20Santani%20Wellness%20-%200468.jpg" alt="image">
            <p>Travel+Leisure’s readership voted for their favourite wellness retreat in the world and have chosen Santani, Sri Lanka as the best in the world. Santani’s unique and scientific approach to wellness and ayurveda has made it stand out once again, with Travel + Leisure elaborating: <br>“ Built with the belief that human beings heal and thrive when surrounded by nature, Santani Wellness Resort & Spa in Sri Lanka features sustainable architecture and minimalist interiors, designed to preserve its green environment. They have added to the global sustainability discussion by introducing the game changing concept of “Human Sustainability” that drives everything at Santani. <br>Being located on a 120-acre former tea plantation, surrounded by a lush green forest, makes the resort both secluded and accessible. Sri Lanka’s first full-fledged destination spa resort believes its success relies on encouraging practices that guests can carry home to continue a healthier lifestyle. It offers programmes that are fully customisable to suit your needs, with a combination of methods such as Ayurveda, yoga, spa treatments, and digital detox.” <br>Aindrila Mitra, Editor of Travel+Leisure India said, "Celebrating the 10th edition this year, we are felicitating trendsetters and trailblazers in the fields of travel and leisure, in addition to our other popular categories. These 10 special categories will felicitate game changers in the fields of conservation, travel photography and storytelling, sustainability, wellness, design, F&B, climate change awareness, community tourism and more.” <br>CEO and Founder of Santani Wellness Resort, Vickum Nawagamuwage commented on the latest accolade. “We are thankful yet again, especially in times like this, to our guests who keeps coming back and voted us as the best in the world, Travel+Leisure, our travel industry partners, and everyone who banded together to help us achieve this laurel. Special thank goes to the team at Santani. This recognition is proof that we have maintained our sometimes-impossible standards through the worst period for global tourism in recent times. We’re taking this recognition to move forward from the COVID-19 challenge by expanding our footprint globally”. <br>When asked about what expansion plans were in the pipeline, Vickum said, “the global demand for wellness is growing exponentially and we want to grow the brand through our own properties as well as management contracts. We are also creating a mid-market brand centered around the same unique concepts that made Santani a world class brand. We have already secured several management contracts and are in discussions with other owners/developers to build/operate properties in Sri Lanka as well as globally”. <br>Recently celebrating its fifth anniversary, Santani has become one of the most celebrated hotels in the world in record speed. The Santani brand imbues purpose into everything from the modern, sustainable architecture to the once-in-a-lifetime gastronomic experience, to the perfect union of modern and ancient wellness methods. Everything that happens during your stay at Santani, happens by design.</p>

            <h3>Sri Lanka Tourism Facilitates the country’s first Cable Car Project to take off soon.</h3>
            <img src="https://srilanka.travel/image/data/news2021/20-12-2021/Screenshot%202021-12-20%20184717.jpg" alt="image">
            <p>The last few years have seen a united and consolidated effort on all fronts, aimed at transforming Sri Lanka into a truly contemporary tourism destination. This includes positioning the island as a land of wonder and awe, overflowing with magical experiences, yet offering modern facilities and world-class amenities. There is also excellent work being done on the ground to ensure the right infrastructure is in place and the island’s countless delights are easily accessible to all visitors. This includes ease of access for the disabled and mobility challenged, as the island strives towards a more inclusive tourism industry. <br> The most recent project in this spirit is ‘The Cable Car Project’, an initiative by the Outdoor Engineering Lanka PVT Ltd, facilitated by the Investor Relations Unit (IRU) of Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA). The project which is a first for Sri Lanka will give the island its first cable car experience, which will span a distance of nearly 4 Kilometers. The Cable Car will connect Nanu Oya, a destination made famous due to its strategically located railway station, with Nuwara Eliya town. This, in turn, will provide an alternative and beautifully scenic route between the two locations. <br> The location chosen for the project takes advantage of the breathtaking scenery and allows visitors a bird’s eye view of the lush green landscape, rolling hills, numerous tea estates, and of course the montane forests of Nuwara Eliya. This new way of locomotion will reduce the direct impact of tourism on nature, while still allowing visitors to observe, interact and enjoy the surroundings with a minimal environmental impact. The project with an investment value that currently stands at EURO 55 Million (USD 62.15 Mn) will be implemented as a “build, own, operate and transfer” model and thus, this agreement allows the total capital investment to be transferred to the Government of Sri Lanka after a period of 30 years. The project is scheduled to be completed within just 18 months from the date of receiving all approvals. Outdoor Engineers AG of Switzerland and its local representative, Outdoor Engineering Lanka Pvt Ltd are exponents of the project. Outdoor Engineers AG brings over 30 years of experience in the ropeway industry and has been involved in over 30 cable car installations all over the globe, including the famous Sentosa Cable Car in Singapore. The cable car equipment will be supplied and installed by partner organization of Outdoor Engineers AG, Doppelmayr Seilbahnen GmbH of Austria, who is the current world leader in cable car manufacturing and installations, having constructed over 15,100 installations in 96 countries.  The Ropeway system used on the project, has a long history of use in the mountainous regions of Europe and has more recently found wide acceptance around the world. What sets them apart from most other forms of transportation is their ease of use, low environmental impact, and sustainable outlook. In fact, cable car systems are ideal for the tourism sector as they have minimal impact on the environment, help drastically reduce emissions, and leave behind no harmful emissions or residue. The project will be built according to the highest global safety standards, reliable, and easy to maintain with cost associated with operation and upkeep. <br> Speaking about this novel and exciting project, The Chairperson of Sri Lanka Tourism, Ms. Kimarli Fernando had this to say, “It gives everyone at Sri Lanka Tourism immense pride to be involved in this project, which is indicative of the progressive attitude we have adopted towards the future of the island and its tourism sector. The IRU division of the SLTDA together with the respective line agencies enabled a high level of competency and efficiency in keeping with international construction, safety, environmental, and quality standards. As a result of an effective and healthy collaboration of all line agencies involved, it allowed for complete compliance with all necessary regulatory frameworks, allowing for greater efficiency and transparency” <br> The design of the ‘The Cable Car Project’ ensures that it blends seamlessly with the surrounding landscape so as to not distract from the natural setting. Care has also been taken to preserve the tree line, canopy, and other aspects of the wilderness during construction and implementation. It was shown that the implementation of the project would reduce harmful greenhouse emissions by approximately 180 metric tons per year. As a BOOT project (Build, Own, Operate, Transfer) the operation will create new industries, opportunities, and jobs in the region. This is essential, as Sri Lanka looks to lift the standard of living across the country while providing more new opportunities to rural communities. The project is also indicative of what can be achieved when the many facets of government work together towards a unified vision. Working closely with Sri Lanka Tourism the UDA signed an MoU with Outdoor Engineering Lanka Pvt. Ltd. on the 09th of December to allocate land for this project on a 30-year lease period and did an excellent job clearing the necessary land, while also establishing strict guidelines for its preservation and use. A collective effort of vital government agencies such as the CEA and Forest Department along with nearly 20 other line agencies were also indispensable to the project’s success. <br> The project is one of several which are underway, under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s ‘Vistas of Prosperity and Splendor’ policy initiative. This is a vital step in the right direction as Sri Lanka positions itself as an exclusive destination, for the high-value experiential traveler. The projects will also bolster the island’s reputation in the eyes of the world, showcasing it as a cosmopolitan destination that has just about everything a world traveler could desire. <br><br> <b>Contact:</b> <br> Public Relations Division <br> Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau <br> 80, Galle Road, Colombo 03.</p>
